# My Website

**Hello World**

This is the future home of my website. The current (well, not very current) version is [here](http://andrewsteinmetz.net).

The website will attempt to meaningfully organize some combination of the following elements:

- A blog
- Documentation of artworks
  * images of sculptures
  * drawings
  * web-based works
  * images of ceramics
  * photographs of the world
- An index of my rock collection
- Music
- A page devoted to my web design business

I am currently considering the following methods of organization:

1. Blogform - everything in a chronological list
2. Project-based - a list of projects, each with its own page, plus a blog
3. Some combination of 1 and 2.
  - Blog as homepage, with links to projects
  - Project-based with a link to a blog
4. Something more abstract
5. Freeform

Currently I'm considering the following technologies:
- github pages for hosting
- Jekyll for blogging
- Angular for my Spirotator

In the meantime, check out my [grid generator](/sass_grundrisse).
