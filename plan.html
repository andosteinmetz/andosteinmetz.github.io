            <p><strong>Hello World!</strong></p>
            <p>This is the future home of my website. The current (well, not very current) version is <a target="_blank" href="http://andrewsteinmetz.net">here</a>.</p>
            <p>The website will attempt to meaningfully organize some combination of the following elements:</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <ul>
                <li>A blog</li>
                <li>Artworks:
                    <ul>
                        <li>images of sculptures</li>
                        <li>images of ceramics</li>
                        <li>photographs</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>An index of my rock collection</li>
                <li>Music</li>
                <li>A page devoted to web design work</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>I am currently considering the following methods of organization:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Blogform - everything shown as a scrolling blog, with categories</li>
                <li>Project based - a list of projects, each with its own page, plus a blog</li>
                <li>A combination of 1 and 2
                    <ul>
                        <li>Blog as homepage, with navigation to separate projects</li>
                        <li>Project index as homepage, with a link to the blog</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Something more abstract, that is neither a blog nor a portfolio, but serves both purposes</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>I'm considering using the following technologies:
                <ul>
                    <li>github pages for hosting</li>
                    <li>Jekyll for blogging</li>
                    <li>Angular for my Spirotator</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
        <p>In the meantime, take a look at my <a href="/sass_grundrisse">grid generator.</a></p>
